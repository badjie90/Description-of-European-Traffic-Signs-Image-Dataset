# Description-of-Traffic-Sign-Recognition-Benchmark-Datasets

This repository contains Traffic Sign Recognition and detection image datasets, which are a multi-class image classification benchmark in the domain of advanced driver assistance systems and autonomous driving. However, it would be a privilege if you wanted to add to this README file if you know of any European Union country or countries that use a different traffic sign and its related statistics.

## 1. Description of the German Traffic Sign Recognition Benchmark (GTSRB) Dataset
GTSRB is a dataset containing images of German traffic signs and can be used to train deep learning image classification models for autonomous vehicles. It is the common traffic sign used across the member states of the European Union except for few membner states.The dataset comprises 12,630 test images and 39,209 training images from 43 classes of traffic signs (speed limit, crossing, stop, traffic signals, etc.). The number of datapoints in each class varies, resulting in some classes having a small number of images while others have a huge number, as seen in the graph and in table 1 below. With a file size of around 314.36 MB, downloading the dataset does not require a lot of time or memory space. It has two distinct folders: train and test. The train folder is divided into sub-folders, each representing a particular class, and each class has a variety of traffic sign images. It was first published at IJCNN 2011 [link](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6033395).

### A visual representation of the number of classes in the GTSRB dataset and their corresponding datapoints.

The graphical representation of this dataset shows that each class has an uneven distribution of images. Approximately 2500 images are used in certain classes, whereas just 250 images are used in others. Because of this, it might be best to use data augmentation when using this dataset to train a deep learning model to avoid making a model that is biased.Â

## 2. Belgium Traffic Sign Classification (BTSC) Dataset

One of the EU nations with distinctive traffic signs from the other EU nations is Belgium. For the classification of traffic signs, the BTSC dataset was created to help both human drivers and autonomous driving. This dataset is composed of a training and test set containing 4591 and 2534 traffic sign images, respectively, with 62 distinct classes of traffic signs. The splitting of the  BTSC dataset comes after the breakup with Belgium-TS. For each physically separate traffic sign, there are often three images or annotations. This dataset was originally collected and designed by GeoAutomation, which records the data in urban settings in the Flanders area of Belgium. The sizes of the BTSC training and testing sets are 171.3 MB and 76.5 MB, respectively. In the context of self-driving vehicles, this dataset was created to develop models for improved driver support systems and autonomous driving. However, this dataset has the issue of signs with identical meanings. We therefore highly advise using exploratory data analysis approaches to find the identical traffic signs and eliminate them from the dataset. The classes in the dataset have a varying amount of datapoints; for instance, some classes have 200 images or less, while others have more than 350 images. As a result, to avoid the model's predictions being biased while using this dataset to train it, we advise using data augmentation.
